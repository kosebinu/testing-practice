# JavaScript Utility Functions with Jest Testing

This project contains a collection of utility functions implemented in JavaScript, each thoroughly tested using the Jest testing framework. These functions cover basic operations and common use cases such as string manipulation, arithmetic operations, and array analysis.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following functions:
1. `capitalize`: Capitalizes the first character of a given string.
2. `reverseString`: Reverses a given string.
3. `calculator`: An object containing basic arithmetic operations (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).
